To print "Hello, World!" in JavaScript, you can use the `console.log()` function. This function prints a message to the browser console.

Here is a simple JavaScript program to print "Hello, World!":

```javascript
// Using console.log()
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

To run this program, you can create a new HTML file and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hello, World!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    // Using console.log()
    console.log("Hello, World!");
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Then, open the HTML file in a web browser. You should see the message "Hello, World!" in the browser console.

Here is an example of how to run the program in the Chrome browser:

1. Open a new Chrome window.
2. Click the three dots in the top right corner of the window.
3. Select **More tools** > **Developer tools**.
4. The developer tools window will appear at the bottom of the window.
5. Click the **Console** tab.
6. You should see the message "Hello, World!" in the console.

You can also use the `alert()` function to print "Hello, World!" to the browser window. However, this function is typically used to display warning or error messages.

Here is an example of a JavaScript program to print "Hello, World!" using the `alert()` function:

```javascript
// Using alert()
alert("Hello, World!");
```

To run this program, simply add the following code to your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hello, World!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    // Using alert()
    alert("Hello, World!");
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Then, open the HTML file in a web browser. You will see a pop-up window with the message "Hello, World!" inside of it.

Which method you use to print "Hello, World!" depends on your specific needs. If you want to print the message to the browser console, use the `console.log()` function. If you want to display the message to the user in a pop-up window, use the `alert()` function.
